# Smart Contract Security Journey
This repository documents my learning journey in Smart Contract Security, starting with [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/), a series of security-focused challenges. For each challenge, I have created detailed audit reports, showcasing identified vulnerabilities and potential mitigations.


1. [CoinFlip Audit Report](./ethernaut/coinflip/REPORT.MD)  
2. [Telephone Audit Report](./ethernaut/telephone/REPORT.MD)  

These reports provide insights into smart contract vulnerabilities and solutions, serving as both a learning record and a resource for others exploring smart contract security.
